So now the Apple stock price wants to rise a week after I couldn't buy out of Wilcox's final ????????????
Man, that guy who sold his 10% of #Apple stock in the 70s for $800 must hate himself. Now it would be worth $58Billion.
RT @petershankman: Having a bad day? Remember that today in 1976, Ronald Wayne sold his 10% share of Apple stock for $800, worth over $56B ?
Non-cheesy sources of royalty-free music? Apple stock loops and various internet sites are killing me with the cheese.
Last time this happened, Apple shares soared: After a stellar start to 2015, Apple stock has been stuck in neutral. But if history is...
# CNBC business channel talks about Apple stock like mad men yet no mention of Bank Of America Stock & how well its doing, is not odd????
Apple stock has gained 1.4% since it replaced AT&T in the Dow two months ago, while AT&T has climbed 2.6%
@Carl_C_Icahn Sorry to bother you I personally don't own Apple stock either long or short.
If you're having a bad day, on this day in 1976, Ron Wayne sold his shares of Apple stock for $800. Today it would be worth $58,000,000,000
Had a bad day? At least you didn't sell your Apple stock in 1976 for $800! http://t.co/06pIhCTk9L
that was a terrible decision selling his apple stock way too soon
@aaarocket37 I've been saying it for over a yr. All the mergers and acquisitions are inflating stocks. I sold all my apple stock last week.
@eringriffith @MikeIsaac "google stock flat, but whoa maybe Pin... [fill in optimistic blank]. No longer lottery tickets but 2-3x notion.
@BradShadesOff same people buy penny stocks that go broke and don't buy Google stock because no value
I'm glad my Mom didn't take my advice to buy @twitter stock instead of @facebook stock.facebook stock is killing it,twitter is doo-doo. WTF?
